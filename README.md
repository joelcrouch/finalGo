# finalGo
haskell game of go
This is a game of Go written in Haskell. Currently all the logic and testing is done in lib.hs, and the gameLoop is called in main.hs.  In the future, tests will be moved
to the spec.hs, such that the code is more readable.  In its current state (3-23-23), the game does not work properly.  The faulty function(s) will be addressed in a future 
repair.
